Hi everyone! My name is Luis, an aspiring Data Scientist/Programmer. I am currently working at a leading consumer finance company specializing in credit products. I work in what I call a hybrid data science and traditional analytics role supporting Internal Audit functions within the organization. This blog is meant to contain things I've learned outside of my day to day job and as a way to organize my thoughts around certain topics. I envision the subjects I will discuss will revolve around programming (Python/Java/maybe C), AI and Machine Learning, and potentially statistics and math topics around AI and Machine learning.
